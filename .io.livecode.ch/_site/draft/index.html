<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Imagine a language where you can change the meaning of any program, and the meaning of the meaning, and the meaning of the meaning of the meaning, ad infinitum — as the program is running. Reflective towers of interpreters provide that.</p>

<p>Initiated in the 80s by Brian Cantwell Smith, reflective towers of interpreters are a semantic model of reflection (the ability to reason and act upon oneself), with a user level interpreted by a meta level interpreted by a meta meta level interpreted by a meta meta meta level and so on for potential infinity. Each level comes with its own REPL and ‘PC counter’, as each level can be thought of as a little interactive machine causally connected with the others. Each level (e.g. user) can reify its program into data at the level above (e.g. meta), and each level above can reflect data back into program at the level below. To explain the causally connected levels, Brian Cantwell Smith draws an analogy: “it is as  if we were creating a magic kingdom, where from a cake you could automatically get a recipe, and from a recipe you could automatically get a cake.”</p>

<p>Reflective towers of interpreters include 3-Lisp (B.C. Smith, early 80s), Brown (M. Wand & D.P. Friedman, 1986), Blond (O. Danvy & K. Malmkjaer, 1988), Black (K. Asai et al., 1996) and Pink and Purple (N. Amin & T. Rompf, 2018). Based on denotational semantics, Brown features first-class reifiers, which are a generalization of FEXPRs that also reify the continuation. Also based on denotational semantics, Blond has a uniform language at each level and focuses on tower manipulation for example permuting two levels. In Black, the interpreter at each meta level can be mutated piece-wise, for example the evaluation of variables can be redefined. Pink and Purple demonstrate that it is possible to “collapse” a tower, that is compile it without interpretive overhead with respect to the current semantics. We will see examples mostly in Black and one in Blond. Implementations and examples of Brown, Blond and Black are available online, as well as those of Pink and Purple.</p>


<h2>Design Considerations</h2>

<p>Reflective towers of interpreters capture the essence of reflection.
We consider the design choices mostly common to all reflective towers.</p>
<ul>
<li>reification / reflection: reification turns a running program into data that represents it (expression, environment, continuation) while reflection reinstates the data into a running program.</li>
<li>up / down: a level is interpreted by the meta level above (so the user level is interpreted by the meta level, and the meta level is interpreted by the meta meta level, and so on...). In a reflective tower, reification goes up the tower while reflection goes down. A reflective tower always has a vantage point.</li>
<li>the tower is conceptually infinite: each level has a meta level. However, the tower can be fully realized by dynamically defaulting above an unmodified level. A meta continuation is a stream of (environment, continuation) pairs representing the potentially infinite tower.</li>
<li>semantics and modified semantics: after a running program is reified, it can be inspected and manipulated and reflected back in many ways. One can write a custom evaluator, or one can transform the program text (expression) and use the default evaluator. In Black, one can change the evaluator piece-wise (for example, only changing the evaluation of variables).</li>
<li>interactivity: each level has a REPL, and one can go up and down the tower in the REPLs.</li>
<li>the tower structure: the tower structure is not all that fixed. In Blond, one can permute levels for example.</li>
<li>causal connection.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="black-walkthrough"></a>Black Walkthrough: Debugging</h2>

<p>We start the Black REPL. Two levels are loaded: the meta level and the meta meta level, because Black needs to look up the meta functions in the meta meta environment even though the meta level is unmodified.</p>
<div class="live" id="black" data-lib="">
black

</div>

<p>We define a function `foo` and create a thunk out of its application.
There is an error, so control passes to the meta level (`1-` from `0-` in the prompt).<br/>
A new level is loaded for the meta meta meta level.</p>
<div class="live" id="s1" data-lib="black">
  (define foo (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (lambda () (f (+ x 1))))))
  (define thunk ((foo 1) 2))
  (thunk)
</div>

<p>We can use the old continuation to jump back to the level below (here the user level). Since the application is at fault, and there are no pending computations, we can just return any value with the continuation.</p>
<div class="live" id="s2" data-lib="black s1">
  (old-cont 'ok)
</div>

<p>Now what are our options to fix this error? One option is to fiddle with the thunk and change the value of `f` in its closure to be a function.
We load some Black code (nothing special) to get an inspector of closure environments.
This code is loaded at the meta level, as indicated by `EM`, a shorthand for `exec-at-metalevel`.</p>
<div class="live" id="s3-1" data-lib="black s1 s2 em-open lib-break em-close">
;;  (EM (load "break.blk"))
</div>

<p>We get a REPL to inspect and modify this environment.
When we exit that REPL, we go back to the level above (here the user level).</p>
<div class="live" id="s3" data-lib="black s1 s2 em-open lib-break em-close s3-1">
  (inspect thunk)
  f
  (set! f (lambda (x) (+ x 2)))
  (exit 'done)
  (thunk)
  (thunk)
</div>

<p>Another option is defining application of numbers so that it multiplies all the numbers together instead of returning an error.<br/>
We load some Black code (again nothing special) at the meta level to re-define the behavior.</p>
<div class="live" id="s4" data-lib="black s1 s2 em-open lib-break em-close s3-1 s3">
  (define thunk2 ((foo 2) 3))
  (thunk2)
  (old-cont 'ok)
</div>
<div class="live" id="s5" data-lib="black s1 s2 em-open lib-break em-close s3-1 s3 s4 em-open lib-multn em-close">
  ;; (EM (load "examples/multn.blk"))
</div>
<div class="live" id="s6" data-lib="black s1 s2 em-open lib-break em-close s3-1 s3 s4 em-open lib-multn em-close s5">
  (thunk2)
  (1 2 3 4)
</div>

<div class="live hidden" id="em-open" data-lib="black">
  (EM (begin
</div>

<div class="live hidden" id="em-close" data-lib="black">
  ))
</div>

<p>What does the Black code to create those inspection and modification look like?
Let's start with the code to re-define application of numbers.</p>

<h3>multn.blk</h3>
<p>This code is to be loaded from the meta level.
The Black meta level defines the interpreter piece-wise.
There is a `base-apply` function that handles applying an operator to an operand, where both have already been evaluated.
We re-define the `base-apply` function to handle an operator that is a number and delegate to the old `base-apply` function otherwise.
</p>
<div class="live" id="lib-multn" data-lib="black">
  (let ((original-base-apply base-apply))
  (set! base-apply
    (lambda (operator operand env cont)
      (cond ((number? operator)
             (base-eval (cons '* (cons operator operand)) env cont))
            (else
             (original-base-apply operator operand env cont))))))

</div>

<h3>break.blk</h3>
<p>For the inspector, we define a special form inspect by changing the eval-application meta function to handle the case.
  <br/>
  The evaluation of the inspect form starts a loop with the closure environment as the running environment.
  <br/>
  The loop function defines a REPL without needing to exit, since that is handled by the meta continuation.
</p>
<div class="live" id="lib-break" data-lib="black">
(define (loop prompt env ans)
  (newline)(write ans)(newline)
  (display prompt)(display "> ")
  (base-eval (read) env (lambda (ans) (loop prompt env ans))))

(define (eval-break pred env cont)
  (define (run-break-loop)
     (let ((result (loop "break" env 'break-loop)))
	(write 'break-end)(newline)
	(cont result)))
  (if (null? pred)
      (run-break-loop)
      (base-eval (car pred) env
		 (lambda (pred) (if pred (run-break-loop)
					 (cont #f))))))

(define (eval-inspect closure env cont)
  (base-eval closure env (lambda (closure)
  (let ((lambda-env (car (cdr (cdr (cdr closure))))))
   (let ((result (loop "inspect" lambda-env 'inspect-loop)))
      (newline)(write 'inspect-end)(newline)
      (cont result))))))

(let ((original-eval-application eval-application))
  (set! eval-application
	(lambda (exp env cont)
	   (cond ((eq? (car exp) 'break)
		  (eval-break (cdr exp) env cont))
		 ((eq? (car exp) 'inspect)
		  (eval-inspect (car (cdr exp)) env cont))
		 (else
		  (original-eval-application exp env cont))))))
</div>

<h2>Example: Instrumentation</h2>

<p>We can modify the interpreter so that it instruments a program in custom ways.<br/>
For example, we can implement an instrumenter specific to There and Back Again (TABA) programs, to visualize the process as it pushes and pops the stack.</p>
<pre>
    (walk (1 2 3))            (((1 . c) (2 . b) (3 . a)))
    |                         ^                         
    V                         |                         
    (walk (2 3))              (((2 . b) (3 . a)) c)     
    |                         ^                         
    V                         |                         
    (walk (3))                (((3 . a)) b c)           
    |                         ^                         
    V                         |                         
    (walk ())                 (() a b c)                
    |                         ^                         
    V                         |                         
    ---------------------------
</pre>

<p>All this mutation at the meta level to realize custom semantics is error prone.
We can implement a meta-level undo by changing the `eval-set!` function in the meta meta level.</p>

<h2><a id="blond-walkthrough"></a>Blond Walkthrough: Tower Semantic Pitfalls</h2>
<p>The reflective tower Blond strives the most to clarify semantics.
Continuations in the tower can be pushy or jumpy, depending on whether they stack a meta continuation or not.
Blond is jumpy by default, while Brown and Black are pushy.
It is possible to convert a continuation from one style to another, as described in the Blond paper.
We start a Blond session, and load the definitions of `pushify` and `jumpify` as well as `exit`, which allows us to exit the current level to the meta level.</p>
<div class="live" id="blond" data-lib="">
blond

</div>

<div class="live" id="t1" data-lib="blond">
  (load "cont.bl")
  (load "exit.bl")
</div>

<p>Now we use a delta reifier to jump to the meta level with the current expression e, environment r and continuation k.<br/>
The body of the `delta` reifier is executed at the meta level.
  In that body, we define `re-enter` to save the reified continuation in a pushy way.<br/>
We use a pushy continuation so that we reinstall level 1 before going back to level 0.<br/>
  We also define a `jump` function at the level below, using `meaning'` which serves as evaluation. In order to access the continuation, we extend the environment. Note that here we don't `pushify` the continuation, because we want to stay at the same level when invoking `jump`.<br/>
Because evaluation uses k as the continuation, we resume back to the level 0.
</p>
<div class="live" id="t2" data-lib="blond t1">
((delta (e r k)
   (begin
     (define re-enter (pushify k))
     (meaning' (define jump k)
               (extend-reified-environment' (k) (list k) r)
               k))))
</div>

<p>Now we can exit to the meta level, and we have a way of coming back to the user level.</p>
<div class="live" id="t4" data-lib="blond t1 t2">
  (exit 'up)
  (re-enter 'ok)
</div>

<p>Notice that we enter back to the same counter (0-4>)!</p>
<div class="live" id="t5" data-lib="blond t1 t2 t4">
  1
  2
  3
  (exit 'up)
  (re-enter 'ok)
</div>

<p>We can also use our defined jump to go "back in time" in a similar way.</p>
<div class="live" id="t6" data-lib="blond t1 t2 t4 t5">
  1
  2
  3
  (jump 'ok)
</div>

<p>Let's go to level 1.</p>
<div class="live" id="t7" data-lib="blond t1 t2 t4 t5 t6">
  (exit 'up)
</div>

<p>What if we want to re-enter level 0 from a level above 1? We can install a `re-enter` at a level above, assuming it is installed at the level below.
From the level below:</p>
<div class="live" id="t3" data-lib="blond t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7">
((delta (e r k)
   (define re-enter
     (lambda (v)
       ((pushify k) ((r 're-enter) v))))))
</div>

<div class="live" id="t8" data-lib="blond t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t3 t3">
;; previous code again
</div>

<p>Now we can jump all the way back to level 0:</p>
<div class="live" id="t9" data-lib="blond t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t3 t3 t8">
  (re-enter 'ok)
</div>

<p>And let's make sure our tower still has the proper shape:</p>
<div class="live" id="t10" data-lib="blond t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t3 t3 t8 t9">
  (exit 'up)
  (exit 'up)
  (exit 'up)
  (exit 'up)
  (exit 'up)
</div>
